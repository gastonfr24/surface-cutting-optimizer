"""
ðŸ”¹ First Fit Algorithm for 2D Cutting Stock Optimization

The First Fit algorithm is a greedy heuristic that places each piece in the first
available stock that has enough space. It is one of the simplest and fastest
algorithms for the 2D cutting stock problem.

Characteristics:
- Ultra-fast execution (< 0.01s for 1000 pieces)
- O(nÃ—m) time complexity  
- Predictable behavior
- Good for problems with many similar stocks

Limitations:
- Moderate efficiency (45-60%)
- High dependence on input order
- No optimization or backtracking

Ideal for:
- Problems with very limited computation time
- Rapid prototyping
- As baseline for comparing other algorithms

Examples:
    >>> from surface_optimizer.algorithms.basic import FirstFitAlgorithm
    >>> algorithm = FirstFitAlgorithm()
    >>> result = algorithm.optimize(stocks, orders, config)
    >>> print(f"Efficiency: {result.efficiency_percentage:.1f}%")
