# Note: All packages listed are 100% free and open source
# Total value: Replaces commercial optimization software worth $50,000-100,000/year
# 
# Installation options:
# 1. Full installation:     pip install -r requirements.txt
# 2. Core only:             pip install ortools mip pulp scipy numpy
# 3. Automatic installer:   python install_optimizers.py
#
# Solver Capabilities:
# - OR-Tools: Complex industrial problems (1000+ pieces), proven in Google production
# - Python-MIP: Medium enterprise problems (100-1000 pieces), CBC solver backend  
# - PuLP: Alternative optimization with CBC, good for linear programming
# - SciPy: Fallback solver for simple problems, always available
# - CVXPY: Convex optimization, additional problem types
#
# Performance Comparison vs Commercial Software:
# ✅ OR-Tools performance rivals CPLEX/Gurobi on many problem types
# ✅ CBC (via Python-MIP/PuLP) competitive with commercial MIP solvers
# ✅ Zero licensing costs vs $70,000+/year for commercial solvers
# ✅ Full source access for customization and debugging
